Collectible Trump Crypto Card game.<br/><br/>

**Why?**<br/>
Jan Emil Christiansen was bored/fired doring the Corona lock down and he started look at enjin videos to make a simple card game.<br/> 
After a few days he fund a good video how to get started https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmd-oDObGas<br/><br/>

**Future plans**<br/>
Mint crypto cards for cryptos that have something special to offer.<br/><br/>

Maybe later enable a Trump Card game engine. Not started to look at the.<br/><br/>
