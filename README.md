# TrumpCryptoCards

Collectible Trump Crypto Card game.

Why?
Jan Emil Christiansen was bored/fired doring the Corona lock down and he started look at enjin videos to make a simple card game. 
After a few days he fund a good video how to get started https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmd-oDObGas

Future plans
Mint crypto cards for cryptos that have something special to offer.

Maybe later enable a Trump Card game engine. Not started to look at the.
